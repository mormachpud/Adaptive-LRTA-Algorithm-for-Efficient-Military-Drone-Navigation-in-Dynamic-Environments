# Adaptive-LRTA-Algorithm-for-Efficient-Military-Drone-Navigation-in-Dynamic-Environments
This work explores an adaptive version of the LRTA* (Learning Real-Time A*) algorithm for dynamic environments, specifically applied to military drone navigation. The goal is to improve pathfinding performance by dynamically adapting heuristic probabilities based on feedback during navigation. We compare the performance of our adaptive LRTA* model with static and stochastic LRTA* variants. Experimental results across different grid sizes show that the adaptive LRTA* algorithm outperforms both static and stochastic approaches in terms of deadlocks and reachability to the target while maintaining competitive path costs and steps.
